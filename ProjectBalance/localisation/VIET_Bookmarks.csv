BM_KINGDOM_OF_JERUSALEM_DESC;The first Crusade into the Holy Land has succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of the Crusader armies. Godfrey of Bouillon now sits as King of Jerusalem, though he claims that the true King of Jerusalem is Jesus Christ. Though Christians everywhere celebrate this great victory,  they can only rest for so long: the Muslims are licking their wounds, preparing to avenge this embarrassing defeat and reclaim the Holy Land. Meanwhile, Emperor Alexios of Byzantium watches warily - realizing his originally simple plan of using the Western barbarians as a mercenary force against the Turks has had unforeseen consequences, perhaps the Byzantine Empire needs to reevaluate the situation in the Holy Land if they are to reclaim the Legacy of Rome.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_RECONQUISTA_DESC;Just a few centuries ago, Islam almost conquered all of Iberia. Just a mere half a century ago,  as Christian Iberia was on the brink of defeat, El Cid bravely fought against the Moors. Now, the winds of change are blowing in Iberia. To the south, the decadent Almoravids are collapsing, replaced by an even more zealous dynasty, the Almohads. Portugal has just officially won its independence. Meanwhile, Castille and Aragon continue to resist the Muslims, hoping that one day their dream of the reconquista will be accomplished. Who will succeed in this turbulent region - Almohad or Almoravid, Spanish or Portuguese, Christian or Muslim?; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_SCOURGE_OF_GOD_DESC;From the East they came, ruthless and without mercy: strange men, dressed in exotic armor and speaking in guttural tongues that none understood. Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis... if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked... or perhaps this is God’s greatest test yet for the faithful.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_OSMANS_DREAM_DESC;With the breakup of the Sultanate of the Rum and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, several warlords in Anatolia seek ame and glory in the ensuing power vacuum. Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, some say that great things will be in store for Osman and his dynasty, and that they might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KHITAN_DESC;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects. However, overthrown by their Jurchen vassals in the early years of the 12th century, remnants of the once-great Khitan have fled to Central Asia, where they seek to re-create their imperial splendor. Having just defeated the once-mighty Kara-Khanids and the Seljuks, the Khitan now have a foothold in the region. Will they continue their conquests, spreading their Sinicized nomadic culture and their Buddhist faith, or will they settle down, content with re-creating their Chinese empire in Central Asia? All that is certain, however, is that the Khitan are not the first horde to appear suddenly from the far east, nor will they be the last.;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects.
